Idea list:

* L2 where J shows visualisations of gradient descent. Scale up + make pretty ones.
* L4 project: build tweet sentiment analysis thing with great visualizations
    * how would you build an app around this?
        * get similar tweets?
        * tweets around a topic at a given time? across time?
* L4, J mentions it's a good idea to get a feel for what metrics look like. Create a notebook for that.
* L3- an app hosted on huggingface. Want to get `lncrna` related work up there.
    * could try and get other models up there as well?
