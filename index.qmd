title: "Notes"

Quick re-start with Quarto:

* add new `.ipynb` to the relevant folder, e.g. `blog`
* add path to `_quarto.yml`
* command line: `quarto preview blog` 
* while on main, `git add .`, `git commit`, `git push`
* quarto publish gh-pages

Q: what other file types can I add? e.g. `md` might be smaller.

fastai idea list:

* L2 where J shows visualisations of gradient descent. Scale up + make pretty ones.
* L4 project: build tweet sentiment analysis thing with great visualizations
    * how would you build an app around this?
        * get similar tweets?
        * tweets around a topic at a given time? across time?
* L4, J mentions it's a good idea to get a feel for what metrics look like. Create a notebook for that.
* L3- an app hosted on huggingface. Want to get `lncrna` related work up there.
    * could try and get other models up there as well?
